Packageview pages, maintained by Daniel Ockeloen / Rob van Maris
----------------------------------------------------------------

These pages are made this stupid for a reason. They use include files to
make sure that no cloud changes are needed and to keep the people who maintain
them to just the maintainers. Also these pages will not be needed anymore once (and if) the packagemanager (part of apps2 project) is activated on www.mmbase.org.

** any changes to these pages will be rolled back if not done by me or rob. If you
want changes mail me at daniel@submarine.nl **

This work is done my me/rob for the mmc and any complains or actions you don't agree
with take it up with mmc@mmbase.org.

Greetings,

Daniel Ockeloen
